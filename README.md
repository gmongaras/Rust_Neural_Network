A bad implementation of a neural network in Rust

If you run into VSCode issues, add the following to your `settings.json`:
`"lldb.cargo": "/home/<username>/.cargo/bin/cargo"`


I have never touched Rust and wrote this in a little bit of an afternoon. This code is super unoptimized lol. I will come back to it and make it better.
